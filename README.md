# BOID PROJECT

In this project we try to visualise the behavior of boids. To the simple formulation by Reynolds we add predators, obstacles and boid individuality.

## HOW TO USE

Install the requirements using pip.

Run the simulation:
python -m boids

Quit:
Esc

Add obstacles or attractors:
Go to where they should be added with the mouse and press o/a

## Examples

This example shows some flying boids (blue triangle) which are hunted by the predators (red triangle) and avoid the obstacles (red circle).
